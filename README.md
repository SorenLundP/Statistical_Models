# Statistical Models - Summaries from Aarhus University Curriculum

This repository contains a series of summary articles based on the Statistical Models course at Aarhus University. These articles are concise and insightful overviews of key topics, written as part of my engagement with the course curriculum. They are intended to deepen my understanding of the course content and prepare me for the oral exam

## Articles Overview

1. **Introduction to Likelihood and Parametric Models**:

   - Covers the concept of likelihood, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), parametric models, Fisher information, and likelihood ratio statistics.

2. **Information Metrics**:

   - Discusses observed and Fisher information, properties of MLEs, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and the Delta Method.

3. **Natural and Exponential Dispersion Families**:

   - Focuses on the structure and intuition behind Natural Dispersion Families (NDF) and Exponential Dispersion Families (EDF), with applications to distributions like Poisson and normal.

4. **Generalized Linear Models (GLM) Principles**:

   - Provides an introduction to GLMs, including random and systematic components, link functions, estimation techniques, and model diagnostics.

5. **GLM for Binary, Proportions, and Count Data**:

   - Explores the use of GLMs for binary, proportion, and count data, focusing on logistic regression, overdispersion, and zero-inflated models.

6. **General Principles of Bayesian Statistics**:

   - Discusses Bayesian inference, including priors, posteriors, MAP estimation, and conjugate priors, with a focus on exponential family distributions.

7. **Bayesian Linear Models and GLMs**:

   - Examines Bayesian methods in linear models and GLMs, including Ridge and LASSO regression, probit regression, and latent variable interpretation.

8. **Bayesian Model Selection and Assessment**:

   - Covers tools for Bayesian model evaluation, including Bayes factors, cross-validation, DIC, WAIC, and posterior predictive checks.

9. **Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)**:

   - Explains the necessity and functionality of MCMC methods, focusing on Gibbs Sampling, Metropolis-Hastings, and diagnosing convergence.
